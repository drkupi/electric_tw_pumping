Interactive dashboard (developed in Streamlit) for analyzing electric tubewell groundwater extraction in Pakistan.

This repository contains the code for the [Electric Tubewell Pumping Analysis Streamlit Application](http://142.93.155.163:8501).

This streamlit application allows users to understand the impact of groundwater extraction by subsidized private electric TubeWells(TW) on the overall water footprint in Pakistan. The application also illustrates how streamlit can be used to analyze behavior of parameterized models and equations. Moreover, illustration of how plotly can be integrated into streamlit is also provided.

## Running this application

This application requires python 3.6+ and installation of streamlit, plotly and pandas. These packages can be installed via pip.
